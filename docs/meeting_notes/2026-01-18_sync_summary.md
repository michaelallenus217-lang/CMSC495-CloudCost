## Key Takeaways

1. **Team aligned on simplicity** — Focus on the rubric, not impressive software. The grade is about collaboration, not complexity.
2. **AI-generated skeleton is OK** — but must be rewritten in the team's own voice before submission.
3. **Timeline approach:**
   - Work done by Monday
   - Tuesday = formatting only
   - Submit clean, and the teacher clicks and grades
4. **Team norms confirmed:**
   - 24-hour response time
   - Contribute a minimum of every 2 days
   - Communicate absences
   - Help each other freely

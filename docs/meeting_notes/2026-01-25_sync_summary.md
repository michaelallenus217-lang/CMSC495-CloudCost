# Saturday Sync Summary

**Date:** January 25, 2026  
**Attendance:** All 5 present

## Frontend (Ishan)
- Prefers ERD adjustment
- 9 GUI components mapped; matches UI flow diagram
- Phase I plan: Dashboard skeleton, navigation, trend chart with mock data
- Using Chart.js
- Will use placeholder data until backend endpoints are ready
- Needs API sync with backend lead this week on endpoint formats

## Backend (Sean)
- Pushed API doc to GitHub
- Using Flask for Python backend
- Stubbing out endpoints with example data (frontend not blocked)
- Credentials stored separately (not in repo)
- Goal: Code shared today, plugged into DB by the end of the weekend
- Will shape the API to whatever the frontend needs

## Database (Tony)
- Azure hosted, tables built
- Connections confirmed
- Will prepopulate ALL tables with simulated data
- Plan: 20-50 services, 10 clients, ~40k rows
- Using Azure's own usage data for inspiration

## Testing (Bryana)
- Test plan basics submitted
- Waiting for the code to start testing

## Project Lead (Michael)
- Sections 1-8 complete, working on 9-11 (Core document ready)
- Final edits Monday, PDF Tuesday
- 100/100 on Project Plan
- Keeping the same rhythm for the remaining weeks

## Decisions
- Region field = nice-to-have, can add a button and build functionality, time permitting
- All tables prepopulated with simulated data; can import data, time permitting
- 30 min meetings are sufficient

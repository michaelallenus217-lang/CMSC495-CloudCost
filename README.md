# Cloud Cost Intelligence Platform

**CMSC 495 Computer Science Capstone — Spring 2026**

## Project Overview

Organizations using multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) often overspend by 30-40% due to unused resources, poor visibility, and fragmented billing. Our platform aggregates cost data across cloud providers, analyzes spending patterns, identifies waste, and provides actionable recommendations for optimization.

**Goal:** Create a unified dashboard that makes cloud spending transparent and actionable.

**Target Users:** IT managers, DevOps teams, and finance departments responsible for cloud budgets.
